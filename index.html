            <h5>HTML5 &amp; CSS Exercise</h5>
            <p>One 'Best Practice' rule I always abide by is to never use an image to replace what I can code. Understanding the value of SEO (search engine optimization); having as much releven text in html is always my goal. Inspired by <a href="https://www.holstee.com/pages/manifesto" target="_blank">Holsteeâ€™s Manifesto</a> I challenged myself to recreate it completely using only HTML and CSS. <br><a href="https://codepen.io/jessicabaros/full/PQEQRQ/" target="_blank">(click here to visit the project)</a></p>

          <div class="half-width">
            <h4>A multipotentialite taking web design by storm</h4>
            <p>My name is Jessica Baros, and am a lover of all things unique and challenging. I am expanding my horizons doing what I do best: solving problems. I use my puzzler abilities with an artist's eye to design and format beautiful websites from the ground up. With leadership skills and clear communications skills I make sure to meet customers needs pixel by pixel.</p>
            <p>I believe that what makes life worth living is learning. Fond of atypical life paths, I am comfortable jumping feet first into unknown territories and learning everything I can accurately and in a way that maximises application potential.</p>
